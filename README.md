# TODO's
Don't know will ever follow up on this, if somebody is here seeing this and interested here you go
- I am using jekyll for this blog page, jekyll is fine but the theme i am using isn't good, because it's light mode i don't like that if there's any way i could alter the theme layout or even change the theme suggest one will figure out something
- Create blogs... duh

# How to create blogs:
Create your file in _posts folder named exacly like the way i say "YYYY-MM-DD-title.md", for reference see the one i have in the folder remember the title if multiple words seperate it with '-' like 2025-09-25-hello-world.md and then what to put inside see the example hello world one\
here's how jekyll does this link[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/]
