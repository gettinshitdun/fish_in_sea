# TODO's
Don't know will ever follow up on this, if somebody is here seeing this and interested here you go
- I am using jekyll for this blog page, jekyll is fine but the theme i am using isn't good, because it's light mode i don't like that if there's any way i could alter the theme layout or even change the theme suggest one will figure out something
- Create blogs... duh
